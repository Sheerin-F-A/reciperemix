    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chocolate cherry cheesecake is pretty easy, but waiting until it is
      chilled before eating is hard to do! The chilling step is an important
      one, as the texture and flavor really benefit from time in the fridge.
      Dark chocolate and cherry are a match made in heaven, in my humble
      opinion.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Place whole sandwich cookies In a food processor or high speed
          blender; pulse several times, until crumbs are quite small.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine crumbs, melted butter, and 1 pinch salt. Stir until well
          blended, breaking up any missed large cookie pieces. Press crumb
          mixture on the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of a 10-inch
          springform pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer and beat on medium
          speed until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in 1 egg at a time, making
          sure each egg is well incorporated before adding the next. Scrape down
          sides of the bowl as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add almond extract and sugar to cream cheese mixture; beat until
          smooth, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup heavy cream, blending well.
          Carefully pour about half the batter into the prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon 1 cup pie filling over the batter in the pan, distributing
          evenly. Spoon remaining batter in a smooth layer on top of pie
          filling. Place filled springform on a cookie sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the center of the
          cheesecake is set, about 1 hour and 5 minutes. Cool in the pan on a
          wire rack, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          For glaze, heat remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream in a small saucepan over
          medium heat until it begins to steam. Remove from heat; add chocolate
          chips and pinch salt. Stir until chocolate is completely melted and
          smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Place cheesecake on the
          lined cookie sheet and release the side of the springform pan. Pour
          chocolate glaze on top of the cooled cheesecake, allowing some of the
          glaze to drizzle down the side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 3 hours or overnight.
          To serve, slice into 16 slices. Top each slice with a bit of remaining
          pie filling.
        </li>
      </ol>
